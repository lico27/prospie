","About the summer 2025 funding round: Despite the recent restructure of our grant-making, we are still receiving an unprecedented volume of applications and so, with a limited grants budget, the chance of a positive outcome is becoming smaller – it was only about 4% in this round from over 450 applications. With a view to being able to fairly review applications, and mindful of applicants' time, the Trustees have taken the decision to significantly change what we do, certainly for next year. We will not, therefore be offering an open application process for the Under-26 programme at all in 2026 and running only a very limited opportunity for our Luton programme. We will review how this plays out next year before deciding the best way forward in 2027 and beyond. Clearly, this is a decision that has been taken with some reluctance as we are only too aware of how many social, cultural and societal issues are being addressed by charities with dedication and purpose.

We prioritise organisations that are embedding lived experience of the issues they tackle into their decision-making.
We prioritise projects that will help organisations make significant change to their delivery, reach or sustainability (not necessarily all three).

Over time, they hope to share data about which organisations and which projects are being funded under the new Impact Framework. Those results may lead to further changes to eligibility or prioritisation as they endeavour not to waste organisations' time. With that goal in mind, they have:  

Reviewed all the questions we ask on our one-stage Small Grants Application to ensure we are asking only for the information we need to assess, prioritise, and reasonably report on our grants.
Introduced a two-stage Large Grants Application – so that organisations who are unlikely to be prioritised get a quicker decision, with less time wasted on completing the full form.

The Scottish Landfill Communities Fund (Slcf),,Restructuring,01/03/2025,The fund's viability is threatened by declining contributions and rising administrative costs.,"The continued reduction in landfilled waste in Scotland means that SLfT revenue is declining. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) reported that 2 million tonnes of waste was landfilled in 2023, a reduction from 4.2 million tonnes when SLfT was introduced in 2015. As a result, SLfT revenues have declined from  ï¿½149 million in 2015-16 to  ï¿½68 million in 2023-24. This long-term trend of decreasing SLfT revenues reflect the success of efforts to encourage diversion of waste from landfill, driven by the SLfT and the introduction of the ban on the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste from the end of 2025.

As SLfT revenues are directly linked to the SLCF funding, when revenues decline contributions to the SLCF also reduce. Contributions to the fund have more than halved since 2015 and the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC) forecast that contributions will drop to around  ï¿½1.4 million in 2026-27.

The operation and administration of the SLCF is set out in legislation. The associated costs of administering the fund in future years will breach the legally permitted limits, as a result of the declining contributions. This leaves the SLCF operationally unviable from 2026-27 onwards.   

This consultation will run for 12 weeks until 6 June 2025 and offers an opportunity to give your views and ideas as to the future of the SLCF.

After careful deliberation, we chose to close our Medical Research programme, enabling us to dedicate more resources to charities that deliver a direct and immediate impact on individuals. At the same time, we merged the Health Education and Relief of Sickness programmes into a single Physical Health programme. Recognising the increasing demand for mental health services, we launched a dedicated Mental Health programme.



While we have historically supported a wide range of health-related charities  � in both physical and mental health  � this broad approach has become unsustainable. As a result, we have refined our funding priorities for the Physical and Mental Health programmes. We publish guidance about our funding priorities in each programme, but we warmly encourage applicants to reach out with any questions.



To ensure our grantmaking remains affordable and to respect applicants' time, we have reintroduced a geographical restriction for our Hospice Care programme (South West England and South Wales). Additionally, grants to our International programme will now be made at the discretion of the trustees and this programme is no longer open to applications.

Key changes include:

Adjustments to our small grant eligibility criteria to include new income thresholds of  �25,000 to  �500,000. Around 85% of charities that submit an annual return to the Charity Commission have an income of less than  �500,000 and we are focusing our support on this group.

Reapplication timelines of two years from the date of the end of a successful award or previously unsuccessful application.

August  � Environment and countryside funding themes
October  � Education and heritage and conservation funding themes
January  � Social inclusion and health and wellbeing funding themes

They will publish specific dates on their website and social media platforms at least two weeks prior to the application window opening.","As shared in our grant making plans earlier this year, the number of applications we receive has increased significantly over the past few years and as a result the proportion of applicants receiving funding has reduced dramatically  � in 2024/25 we received almost 1,500 small grant applications.

individuals dealing with bereavement (children and parents of children and young people).

Restructuring",03/01/2025,"The foundation is introducing tighter criteria and monthly funding panels due to high demand.
","
In recent months there has been a significant increase in the number of applications received. This has happened because of changes in our own funding programmes, changes from other funders, and several years of pressure on the voluntary sector, not least from the pandemic and high inflation.

Based on our available funds we anticipate a significantly reduced approval rate in the applications we are currently reviewing. As such, we need to introduce tighter criteria to ensure our funds reach those organisations most aligned to our mission. We will prioritise support for organisations which are:

 ��  led by members of the communities they serve.

 ��  based in or working in one or more of the areas we have been less successful in supporting: Enfield, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, and Redbridge.

 ��  able to demonstrate the ability to deliver their proposed work effectively.

 ��  working with communities and individuals experiencing disadvantage and marginalisation (such as minoritised communities, low-income families, D/deaf and/or disabled people, and other vulnerable groups or protected characteristics).

 ��  able to present clear outcomes demonstrating significant potential impact for their target communities.

In addition, we will give priority to organisations with:

 ��  turnover of less than  �500,000.

 ��  more than 30% of turnover from non-statutory sources.

 ��  free reserves equivalent to 1- and 9-months' expenditure.

Successful applications will not have to meet all these criteria, but we will use them when we consider the relative strengths of funding requests against our available budget.

We know this means there will be a considerable amount of excellent work that we cannot support.

To ensure that our grant budget is managed fairly across the coming months, we are also introducing a new step of monthly funding panels. These panels will look at all funding recommendations for the month and agree which should be taken forward.

We are still aiming to provide decisions within our current 4 �6-month target but recognise this additional process could create some delay. We will do our best to keep you informed of the progress of your application.

The Schroder Charity Trust has been providing one-off grants of up to  ï¿½5,000 towards a broad range of charitable purposes for a significant period. However, in recent years the volume of applications has increased to an unsustainable level.
Our recent analysis has identified that the current success rate for grant applications is approximately 1 in 14.

The following focus on adults only: 

Asylum seekers and refugees  � support work to benefit refugees, asylum seekers, and refused asylum seekers, including those held in detention. The focus has been changed to women only. The focus is on those women who are seeking asylum in the UK, and female refugees who have been through the asylum system; rather than people who arrive in the UK through community sponsorship or via resettlement schemes.

Offenders and ex-offenders  � support for penal reform and fund groups working with offenders in prison and out in the community. The focus now is solely on organisations supporting female offenders, and those in prison for violence against women.

Older People  � funding is focused on projects that benefit isolated elderly people (generally aged 70+) including those with dementia. There will now be a greater focus on specific areas of work for the elderly especially for those in rural and more deprived areas.


People affected by violence or abuse  � work that supports both men and women who are, or have in the past been, affected by violence or abuse. This includes projects supporting people affected by rape and sexual abuse, domestic abuse, stalking, trafficking, prostitution and modern slavery, honour-based abuse, female genital mutilation, and forced marriage. The funding can also support work with perpetrators aiming to lessen isolation and prevent the risk of further abuse.

Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Communities  � support groups within these communities and organisations that work to benefit them. Funding can support work that raises awareness of the issues Gypsy and Traveller communities face, and work to combat hate crime, stigma, discrimination and inequalities, including the lack of appropriate accommodation or other service provision.

People with mental health issues  � support for mental health charities and projects that benefit people with moderate or severe mental health issues.

Young people  � aged 12-21 who are vulnerable, socially excluded or marginalised with a focus on those who are persistently absent from school; school leavers with no qualifications; and young people in/leaving care.

Provide Hospice Care – core funding of hospices is a priority.Typical grant sizes range from £10,000-£30,000. We are currently closed to capital funding.

Provide support for the Homeless – typical core funding grant sizes range from £4,000-£7,000. We look to support organisations in this category with a total annual income of below £1m. We are currently closed to capital funding.

Typical grant sizes range from £1,000-£5,000. We look to support organisations in this category with a total annual income of below £150,000. As this is a broad area we would encourage you to contact us prior to applying for further guidance.","The Albert Hunt Trust was established on 12 January 1979 and has distributed grants totaling more than £40m to date.

When the Trust was originally set up the founders were clear in their intention to support a broad range of causes, including hospice care, winter night shelters for the homeless, and individuals facing social deprivation.

Over the ensuing years the Trustees have pursued this approach and continued to support charities with similar aims and objectives to those organisations originally funded by the founding trustees.

Furthermore, a steadfast commitment to provide unrestricted core funding has been at the forefront of the provision of grants with little or no reporting required, thus entrusting the organisations supported to continue to deliver their objectives.

With the unprecedented recent effects on society, through the pandemic and current cost of living crisis, there is a stark increase in the dependence being placed upon civil society as a source of intervention.

This has consequently caused the Trustees to question ‘why does the Trust exist?’ and ‘why does the Trust need to exist forever?’.

With the acknowledgement that there is much immediate need for financial support the Trustees have decided to act now by concentrating on the spending of the Trust’s remaining resources within a specific timeframe seeing The Albert Hunt Trust mark its 50th anniversary in January 2029 by closing.
