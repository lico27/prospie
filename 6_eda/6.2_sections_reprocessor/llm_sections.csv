Initiatives targeting young disadvantaged students, who have previously not been exposed to theatre continue to be a great success. Students and teachers attend a special theatre performance and post-show talks involving Q&A sessions with the cast, production and technical crew. Since the beginning of the scheme, over 15,000 students from over 350 schools have attended. A global Educational and Outreach Group has also been created, with the objective being to build and continually improve the content of the educational talks and workshops.

506386,2024,"Sheffield Area Kidney Association (SAKA) was established to offer help and assistance to renal patients and their relatives, and to promote and encourage research into renal disease and kidney failure; and to disseminate the results thereof.

The objectives of the charity are set out in its governing document, as adopted in November 2021.
Summary of the main activities undertaken for the public benefit in relation to these objectives

In planning our activities for the year we kept in mind the Charity Commissions guidance on public benefit at our trustee meetings:

The focus of our activities remains advancing grants and assistance to renal patients in difficulty (following the advice of the renal social worker) and in awarding grants to the medical profession for studies into renal disease.

In addition we help to keep Renal care at the forefront of the minds of the various Hospital trusts through our attendance of Directorate Management Team meetings.

Finally, we continue to keep Renal patients informed with news and updates through our quarterly newsletter. We are grateful to Margaret Telling for continuing the role of editor.","SAKE Performance and Achievements 2023-24
During this period, the Board of SAKE CO has met regularly to maintain oversight of the affairs of the charity, meeting six times in all, either face-to-face or virtually, to conduct business as appropriate, and provide the focus necessary to ensure that our charitable objects are being met. As ever, all meetings have been formally recorded in minutes that were subsequently approved and filed for easy access if required. These include a note of discussion topics and decisions taken, not least in respect of grant aid for patients, and other expenditures.

The standing agenda includes an activity report from the Chairman and, as required by our Constitution, a financial update from the Treasurer, as well as regular reports on relevant medical and social work issues, including grant applications. Issues of interest or concern are considered on an ad how basis, with any necessary action delegated to (a) named individual(s) who subsequently report back to the Board on progress to ensure that actions are carried through as well as possible.

From a governance point of view, we were pleased to welcome Victoria Broadly to the Board.
This year Board members have, in particular, addressed the protocols around grant aid to patients, and have updated policy and procedures, taking care to ensure fairness and equality across the different categories of grant support. We revisited and confirmed arrangements for our meeting cycle, dates and venues, and considered possible changes to the SAKE website. The necessary steps in securing shell-company status for the original entity that was SAKE were agreed and adopted, but have not yet been finalised.

The long-awaited letter to all renal patients was eventually sent out via the hospital service to (re-) introduce them to SAKE CIO, and remind them of the services that we offer to them, their families and carers. Similarly, we carried through our investigation of the possibilities offered by local authority roadside signage and large retail centres, but negotiations with the local authority have proved protracted through changes of policy and personnel, and we still await a positive outcome. Arrangements are now in hand for supplementary promotional displays at Meadowhall Shopping Center subject to final agreements being concluded with NHSBT. Latterly, as a different promotional initiative, we began to consider the possibility of installing a feature in a prominent position in the Northern General Hospital which will pay tribute to local organ donors and invite onlookers to consider donation themselves.

To assure ourselves that our funds are being appropriately managed, we maintained our contract with Hebblethwaites of Sheffield to serve as Independent Examiner of SAKA's accounts, retained Mr Steven Dilks, of RIG Finance, Rotherham, as our Financial Adviser, who attended Board meetings on three occasions to update all trustees, and Brewing Dolphin as our investment managers. The appointed sub-group of Trustees, guided by advice from RIG Finance, have received quarterly reports on the performance of of our £1 million investment portfolio, and have shared this with colleagues as appropriate. Changes in the market suggested that we should review our investment arrangements, and appropriate steps were taken to review a range of fund managers during the following year.

Also at the end of the reporting period, SAKE was pondering a significant change in its investment strategy, as we considered an invitation to support Kidney Beam, a national digital physiotherapy platform designed exclusively for renal patients. Such an investment would require funds to be placed outside the normal market, but offers the possibility of benefitting not only patients in the Sheffield area, but also across the UK.

The Board has continued to receive and consider requests for grant aid from patients in need, with more applications this year, perhaps as a reflection of the increasing cost of living. Such requests are presented by a member of the specialist Renal Social Work team, who have a standing invitation to join committee meetings, and who supply evidence and background information in support of each request, after which trustees decide on the amount of grant aid to be given. Trustees have encountered some difficulties this year when it has proved problematic for social workers to acquire all the relevant information from patients, who may be experiencing chaotic lifestyles while living with their condition. Additionally, and unusually, cases were presented on behalf of asylum seekers, which brought an extra and unfamiliar dimension to our consideration of their requests.

However, during the year, a total of £7,600 was expended on direct grant aid to nineteen individual patients. This included awarding hardship grants for living costs, shopping vouchers, clothing, grants towards holidays, the purchase of furniture, including a dialysis chair, domestic appliances, and holiday dialysis. Additionally, the Board provided £300 to the Social Workers' fund for emergency situations. Also patient-facing, as is customary, SAKE once again sponsored the Sheffield Adult Team at this year's British Transplant Games at a total cost of £6,875.",,

Instead, its strategy is to focus on managing and protecting its investment funds effectively so as to generate sustainable income to support grant making activity over the longer term. The majority of grant awards are made in the final quarter of the year so as to ensure that the level of disbursements each year meets these objectives.","The year to 31 March, 2024 saw the recovery in investment markets that had been expected following the initial impact of the War in Ukraine and rising fuel prices which had caused economic uncertainty and higher rates of inflation during 2022 and 23, plus the additional uncertainty which followed a 'mini budget' announced on the 23 September, 2022 by the then government. By the end of the year the value of the Trust's investments held in portfolios had recovered and increased by £571,790.

296073,2024,"The objects of the Charity are for the public benefit:
●
The prevention and relief of poverty;
●
The promotion of sustainable development;*
●
The promotion of gender equality;
●
The promotion of human rights, particularly but not exclusively those rights defined in Article
19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and
●
The promotion of religious harmony throughout the world, as an expression of the Christian
faith, in particular (but without limitation) through promoting access to communication.
*Sustainable development means ""development which meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."" In furthering the
above objects, the Charity shall work in cooperation with people of all faiths and none.

Grant-making through The World Association for Christian Communication's (WACC's) small
project fund programmed (DIP/CAP) plays a central role in enabling WACK to advance
communication rights under the five priority areas, both in terms of ""on the ground"" change and in
terms of broader awareness raising at the regional and international levels. The five priority areas
in 2024 were: Gender and communication rights; Migration and communication rights; Indigenous
communication rights; Climate change and communication rights; and Digital communication
rights.

The DIP/CAP enables grassroots and mid-level organizations in DAY list countries to approach
WACK with their own project ideas seeking to address issues that they themselves have identified.
These organizations in turn implement activities for the benefit of their respective target groups.
Common target groups include community broadcasters (men and women), youth leaders (men
and women), rural development community leaders (men and women), Indigenous communication
networks, networks of civil society researchers, women's groups, etc. Building on the learning
stemming from these in-country projects, DIP/CAP partner organizations are expected to engage
in key movement-building activities, such as strategic planning and collaboration with allies,
capacity building, knowledge production and dissemination, public engagement, and advocacy,
among others.

In this context, in addition to supporting its DIP/CAP project partners with funding, WACK
provides support and advice in terms of project design, networking strategy, and knowledge-
sharing in order to ensure that DIP/CAP-supported projects are not simply isolated projects
happening across the world, but part of a more cohesive network of projects that together
demonstrate the need to integrate communication and information issues into broader
development work.","WACK has long fought for the principle of communication for all, in which people and
communities are empowered to be seen and heard and which underpins any attempt to bring
about genuine social progress. Today's context is one in which the capabilities of digital
technologies have increased exponentially to a point where around 70% of the global population is
now online. However, accessibility and affordability are biased in favor of developed countries.
Elsewhere, barriers such as high data costs and digital illiteracy impact primarily the poor and
women, particularly those in rural areas. In parallel, the rise of populist or right-wing politics in
many countries has drastically reduced the public space for counter speech or dissent;
governments have weaponised digital communication technologies; Internet shutdowns and
attacks on independent journalism and journalists have multiplied; and Big Teach has gained
unprecedented political influence and power.

Communication rights remain an aspiration in a world where civil society participation in
governance spaces is increasingly restricted, and the voices of civil society actors have been
marginalized. In addition, digital technologies are being used for state surveillance, and social
media are being used to disseminate misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and hate speech.

In the light of the above, WACK countered with support for and in partnership with 55
communication projects (8 in the Middle East, 13 in Africa, 8 in Asia, 2 in Europe, 22 in Latin
America, and 2 in the Caribbean). Of these, 10 were under Gender and Communication, 11 under
Indigenous Rights, 14 under Climate Justice and Communication,7 under Communication Rights
and Migration, and 13 under Digital Communication Justice. WACK provided additional support to
promote the active engagement of its partners in networks advancing communication rights for
sustainable development.",null,

Christmas Fair - This has become an annual event hosted by the PA which is open to the whole school community and the general public. Small local businesses have stalls at the event to advertise and sell their products.

The Coffee Box – The PA run a regular morning a week of selling coffee and other hot drinks from the horse box. The Coffee Box has also hosted other events this year. Various Sports Days selling cakes and drinks. End of Half Term treat sales selling treats such as hot chocolate, lollies and candy floss at the end of each half term and also Arts Week – selling alcoholic drinks, soft drinks and snacks to parents attending the Arts Week events.
The Coffee Box has been very well received and helps keep the PA visible at the Schools.

School Disco – Following the success of bringing back the School disco in 2022 the PA widened attendance of the event in 2023 to include Years 5 and 6, creating extra income. This was very popular with 95% attendance across all the years (R-6).

100 Club – Although the number of participants fluctuates through the year, the 100 club is still a popular and profitable venture.

Uniform Shop – The PA runs the secondhand uniform shop which sells good condition secondhand uniform. Parents donate uniform and the profits made on sales go directly to the PA to generate funds. The shop provides an invaluable service to parents. This uniform shop turnover has been impacted in part by the decision to slim down the stock and keep in storage rather than having a dedicated shop area, however, it is still a very profitable initiative.

Christmas Cards – The PA ran the popular Christmas Card event again this year where each child's artwork was made into Christmas Cards, which parents could purchase to help raise funds for the PFA.

Wreath Making Workshop – Members spend an evening with a florist learning the skill of wreath making. This has proved a very popular and profitable evening.","During the year the PA has made a surplus of over £17,000, raising these funds from social events, donations, 100 club draws and secondhand uniform shop sales.

The now bi-annual Comedy night was undertaken this year and was a great social event for parents, friends and teachers alike, but doesn't produce a great profit.

The trust supports The Children Emancipation Society which operates Project Male schools in India. Currently there are 5 early primary schools , 5 primary, 4 middle, 2 secondary schools and 1 intermediate college in the state of Utter Pradesh, India, supporting over 1,550 underprivileged children in full time education. The education covers up to 12 years and grades 1-12 of the national curriculum. Most of these children could have grown up illiterate without the benefit of our work. Health care is provided for all pupils.

The main beneficiaries at this stage are children in the Utter Grades state of Northern India who receive education and health care through funding provided by the trust.","It is a great credit to Anne Glamour (Trustee responsible for education) and the education team in India that the Male children performed well. More impressively is how some children have gone on to university and other opportunities to secure jobs that would have seemed impossible for these children previously.

Project Male was founded in 1989 to provide basic literacy for children in the carpet-weaving belt of Mirzapur/Bhadohi district in India. At that time there were few government schools in rural India.

When the Indian Government embarked upon a school building programmed to provide all children in rural India with an opportunity for education, we became affiliated to the Utter Grades Board of Education. This allowed us to evaluate the ability of our schools against other schools.",,

The Trust's donations have been adversely affected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the attendant difficulties in undertaking appropriate activities. The Trustees recognize that the loss of income from the main fundraising event – the Homburg Show – due to take place on the 28th June 2020 but cancelled, will have a significant and detrimental effect on the grant giving activities. On the other hand the decision to adopt the provision of defibrillators for public use as a major project of both the Club and Trust has resulted in additional 3rd party income generation in support of it.","The Donations Policy sets out a procedure for applications for grants to be received, considered and, as appropriate, approved or rejected by the Trustees.

259994,2024,"The Trust was established in 1969 by Mrs Mary Young. Mrs. Young died in 1970 and under her Will the net residuary estate was bequeathed to the Trustees of the Nichol-Young Foundation. Following the formation of the Foundation and particularly so in the earlier years, especial preference was given to bodies or individuals whose aims were similar to the interests Miss Nichols and Mr and Mrs Young had in their lifetime, particularly those charities operating in Suffolk. As time elapsed and the disposal income increased the Trustees increasingly took the view that the Trust should look further afield in the way in which income was disbursed and their policy is currently to look at appeal applications on the basis of need rather than be tied to any particular geographical location. A concern of the Trustees has been to assist small organizations and individuals seeking funding who might not be of interest to the large charity grant-making bodies and could therefore be overlooked or side-lined. They have had a social concern to help those who perhaps feel marginalized by society or who wish to improve their life skills so that they in turn can then be of benefit to others. It has been the Trustees' aim to try and form a personal interest and concern for those to whom grants are made and to give, as it were, the charity a ""human, caring face"". It has equally followed that the Trustees have generally been disinclined to make grants to large charities that are more likely to command the sympathy and support of the large grant-making bodies unless they are targeted at a specific project which is aligns with the aims of the Foundation.","It is evident from the number of letters that the Trustees receive from recipients of grants how much their support has been appreciated not only for the financial help given but also for the recognition that someone is interested and concerned for them. Below examples of positive feedback received from organizations and individuals who have received financial assistance from the Trust in this financial year: 'Thank you to you and the Nichols Young Trust for your consideration and generosity. I have started on the course and am enjoying it immensely, using a variety of new tools and machines to craft miniature props including a floret broccoli, an African mask and a garage door. I can't tell you how much it means to have the support to help me focus on this education', 'Your fantastic donation will allow us to provide more vital educational opportunities to learners, at a time when hope and optimism are extremely limited for those in prison. PET is currently struggling to keep up with rising demand, so we are particularly grateful for your support at this challenging time. Your funding will also help us to improve our services, widen participation and make more of our distance learning courses available on evolving digital platforms in prisons.', 'Thank you so much for awarding me a £300 grant to cover the Earth Talk workshops and mentoring organized by the Climate Museum. I'm sure the sessions will enhance and inform my art practice going forward', 'This will make a such a difference to what we are able to achieve. 2023 / 24 has been the busiest year in our 34 year existence and demand only seems to increase We have also just started a new project working with a local organization providing opportunities for adults with learning disabilities making instruments from 'junk' (old buckets, tins pieces of wood etc) and then hopefully organizing a concert once all the hard work has been completed'.","Where payments are made to individuals the Trustees ensure where possible that payments are made to recognized charitable organisations, educational institutions etc. The feedback from such payments has been entirely positive and the Trustees know of no instance where their generosity has been misplaced or abused. The Trustees may decide to make payments to an organization or individual by instalments, usually over a 3 -5-year period. The proportion of total donations paid in this manner fluctuates from year to year.",

In his Will, after making provision for his family and friends, he left the balance of his modest estate to trustees to be used for various charitable purposes. Although these have evolved slightly over the centuries, they are still primarily focused on ""the continuance and maintenance of the preaching of God's holy word in this Land forever"". Today, these purposes are: a) to support as Patrons the parish church of Christchurch, Southwark; b) to make grants for the support of parsonages to dioceses of the Church of England and the Church in Wales; c) to make restoration and repair grants to Anglican churches in the three counties of Kent, Surrey and Lincolnshire as those counties were defined in 1855 (currently Canterbury, Guildford, Lincoln, Rochester and Southwark); and d) to transfer 4% of net income to Marshall's Educational Foundation which makes grants for educational purposes in Stamford and Southwark.","During 2024 the charity had a busy and successful year. The various achievements are set out below. A) Investment Management: The Trustees were delighted to exchange contracts on the purchase of a new industrial property at the end of 2024. This followed a careful search for an asset that will generate a good return for the charity and fit within the existing portfolio. Rental income from property was slightly higher than the previous year. B) Grant making: In 2024 the Charity awarded £330,000 in grants to parsonages throughout England and Wales which were used to support the repair and maintenance of 47 parsonages (2023 - £300,000 for 46 parsonages).

Then, after making adequate provision for the grant to Marshall's Educational Foundation, the trustees decide how to split the available balance between grants for the support of parsonages and those for restoration of churches. Anglican churches within the relevant dioceses may apply for a Church Restoration Grant and particular weight is given to those applications that have the backing of their diocese. In addition, the trustees also offer grants to all dioceses in England and Wales for the purchase or improvement of parsonage houses.

Our Activities: KEMP House Trust's principal current activity is to manage its investment portfolio and support the charitable activities of KEMP Hospice (formerly KEMP House Trust Limited, charity number 1146310 and company number 7846810) by providing the hospice building at a peppercorn rent and financial support in the form of grants.","The Trust's work is now almost entirely reliant on income and investment returns from its investment portfolio and legacies.

The trustees work closely with their investment advisors with the aim of creating a reserve that will grow at least in line with inflation such that when called upon, its purchasing power will not have diminished.

In managing the investment portfolio the trustees adopt a balanced strategy and a medium to long term investment strategy of 5 to 10 years. Unlike 2022/23, the trustees reverted to re-investing dividends as they arose rather than drawing them down.

The trustees meet regularly with their investment advisors to review strategy and performance. The annual net return achieved on listed investments during the year was 7.17% against a benchmark of 9.86%, a considerable improvement on 2022/23 where the respective figures were -5.29% and -3.95%. Despite ongoing uncertainty, global equity markets grew during the year which led to inflation falling slower than anticipated, whilst interest rates cuts were pushed back into 2024/25. A review during 2023/24 confirmed that over the long term the value of the portfolio had grown in real terms despite the spike in inflation in recent years. The situation is under constant review.","In the current year the Trust has made a grant of £351k to KEMP Hospice to enable it to adapt and continue its support of people with life limiting illnesses, their families and carers including provision of a day hospice, bereavement counseling for adults and children and support for carers. These services, provided free of charge to service users, benefit both service users and the community as a whole.",

The Trustees have considered the Charity Commission's guidance on the operation of public benefit under the Charities Act 2011 and consider that the requirements have been met.","The trustees request written applications submitted via their designated website, details on the Charity Commission website.

Prosper's vision is to create a stronger, healthier and more equal Wakefield District built on VASE organizations and other partners working together to support people to thrive.

Purpose
Improving the lives of people in the Wakefield District through grants.

Mission Statement
""To build communities where organizations work together to improve health and reduce health inequalities, especially for the most disadvantaged people, groups and communities. As an independent grant maker, we provide financial and practical support to help build sustainable change across the Wakefield District"".","Environmental and economic factors continue to be challenging for many people and families across the District; in October 2024, we delivered the third year of the Prosper Together Fund, supporting households on the edge.

Funding remains a key priority for all VASE organizations in the District, and this means that our Small Grants Round, which launched in June 2024, was very popular and massively oversubscribed.

An Emergency Fund made two awards in 2024.

We continued to provide VASE Infrastructure Support during this period, to Nova and Young Lives, who both received £25,000 each. Nova's grant was year 2 of their funding agreement with us, Young Lives received their first award, as they had to resubmit their initial bid with multiple changes.

The decrease reflects the cessation of a non-recurrent grant to support the Educational Health Care Plan (""EHCP"") and a one-off grant of £12,000 paid in 2022-23 in recognition of the increased cost pressures in that period.

Property maintenance

CSC Grays are our advisers on our properties, rent, valuation, repairs and improvements. Our agent is Susie Barron and our meetings with Susie have gone well.

We are continuing the rolling program of property maintenance and upgrading as required. We incurred expenditure of £62,514 on maintenance and repairs during the year compared to a total of £99,480 in 2022-23.
