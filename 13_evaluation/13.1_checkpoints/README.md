# Checkpoints

This folder (locally) contains seven pickle files: `funders_df.pkl`, `grants_df.pkl`, `pairs_df.pkl`, `areas_df.pkl` and `hierarchies_df.pkl` contain the dataframes used in the scoring logic development notebook and have been saved as checkpoints before the development and testing takes place. The additional pairs dataframes, stored as `embed_df.pkl` and `eval_df.pkl`, are used as extra inputs to assist with development of the logic.
