# Checkpoints

This folder (locally) contains six pickle files: 
1. `funders_df.pkl`, `recipients_df.pkl` and `embedding_pairs.pkl`. These files contain the dataframes used in the model and approach selection notebooks and have been saved as checkpoints before the experimentation takes place.
2. `funders_df_em.pkl`, `recipients_df_em.pkl` and `embedding_pairs_em.pkl`. These files contain the dataframes after the embeddings have been created for the selected text columns, to avoid having to rerun the embedding creation process.
